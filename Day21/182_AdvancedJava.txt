		3 Request =>
				It transfer the data using http protocol 
		4 Response => 
				It get the mesg from server & get back to ur client 
		
3 Http Request & Http Response

		1 Request Header 
			- ip 
			- Date 
			- HTTP protocol version 
			- Http method 
			- Content Type 
				- image 
				- video 
				- audio 
				- Application json
				- text/html 
				- PDF 
			- Auth Token 
			- server address 
		2 Request Body 
			- Data 
				1 json format 
				2 text/html 
				3 XML format (outdated)
				
	Http Response

			- Http method 
			- Content Type 
				- image 
				- video 
				- audio 
				- Application json
				- text/html 
				- PDF 
			- Auth Token 
			- server address 
			- Status code 
				1 2xx => 200-299 => Success/Ok 
				2 3xx => Redirection => 300-399
				3 4xx => Client Error => 400-499

Server 
	1 Web Server 
		- It is used for static web content 
		- nginix, IIS 
	2 Application Server
		It is combination of 
		web server + Its Additional features of that server 
		- tomcat , IBM  websphere, 
	
4 Http Methods
	1 get => It fetch a data from backend server & given to front end server 
	2 post => To send a data from frontend server to backend server
	3 put  => To update a particular record 
	4 delete => To delete a particular Record 


summary & Interview Questions
1 What is Web Server?
2 Explain Types of Web Server
3 Explain Http Methods
4 How Server-client Application Flow?



Today's Lecture Agenda
1 Json Object
	- java script Object Notation 
	- It is light weight Object 
	- It is store data into Key & value format 
	obj={
		id:9,
		"fname":"Sumit",
		"lname":"Raokhande"
	}
	
2 Array of Object
	[
		{
			id:9,
			"fname":"Sumit",
			"lname":"Raokhande"
			"country":{
				"cid":"1",
				"cname":"India"
			}
		},
		{
			id:3,
			"fname":"Spruha",
			"lname":"Raokhande",
			"country":{
				"cid":"1",
				"cname":"India"
			}
		},
		{
			id:6,
			"fname":"Kiran",
			"lname":"Raokhande",
			"country":{
				"cid":"1",
				"cname":"India"
			}
		}
	]
3 Rest Vs Soap
	
	+ REST 
		- Typically REST works on top of HTTP protocol
		- Can be accessed from any device which has internet connection.
		- REST is lightweight (than SOAP)
			- gives freedom -- XML or JSON -- JSON is preferred.
			- JSON processing is lighter.
			- JSON needs less data

	+ SOAP 
		- SOAP services gives XML data 
		- Can be accessed & processing XML data needs more device config.
			- XML processing is heavy
			- XML needs more data=> It required more memory consumption

	
4 Difference between Spring & Spring Boot
	Spring 
 1 Spring is Freamwork
 2 You have to create explicitly IOC Container
 3 If you work with mvc or REST API then you need to configure tomcat server by yourself.
 
Spring Boot
1 It is  tool which makes the work easier to create ready to run application.
2 IOC Container is create automatically we don't required to create explicitly.
3 Where as in Spring Boot it is embedded tomact server in it. It is making your life easier.
5 Http end point URL => 

localhost:8080/firstapi
